# Problem Statement
(As per given in E-ROBO contest held by IEEE NIT Patna ,I had participated)


<br/>

-The goal of the task is to simple “Line Following + Obstacle Avoidance Automated Robot” using webots.
<br/>
-Do the simulation in **webots**
<br/>
-Teams are free to select the dimensions of their robot keeping in mind that the test case is 3X3 units equal to the final arena.
<br/>
-You can download webots from this link:https://cyberbotics.com/#cyberbotics
<br/>

 

#### What to do?

these thing to be done in the solution folder:

 - design arena as per given in the file named "arena"
 - choose any number of sensors, actuators or motors to construct you bot. 
 - easier testing and debugging
 - compact and clean code of controller can be done using c/c++/python  with respect to the arena that has to be built by you.
 - start position of the bot be :
                            **x** = 0.355417
                            **y** = 0.427712
                            **z** = 1.38351
                           <br/>
                           
  - end point be:            **x** = in the range of -2.1 to -2.2
                              **y** = 0.0430075
                              **z** = in the range of -1.48 to -1.51
 
<br/>


<br/>

## arena.wbt:
- built arena world

<br/>
<br/>

## robofin.wbo:
- exported bot


<br/>



## final.wbt

- final simulation world 
- 
<br/>


**Code of controller is coded in "C++" language **

**complete code is given in the folder named "my_controller157" **

## final.mp4
- simulation screen recorded
